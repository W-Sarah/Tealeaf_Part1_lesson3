1. HTML : HyperText Markup language- language used to write webpages and structure them
CSS : language used to format web pages 
Javascript: language used to animate webpages

2. Major parts of an HTTP Request:
- Method (post or get)
- Page URL
- Request line/ Header field
- Body
- parameters

3. Major parts of an HTTP answer:
- Header : Response code
- body (displaying the page)

The GET Method transfers the data within the URL itself
url.com/?username=bob

the POST method uses the body portion of the HTTP request to pass parameters

5. Developpers should know that HTTP is stateless as it impacts the way an application is build. If we want a state to be maintained within the application we need to do so with cookies.

6. Due to the convenience of web browsers.

7. MVC (Model View Controller)  is a pattern used to implement user interface

Sinatra
1. Each request is processed via a route associated with a block. The route gives the URL/method selected and the block the action associated with it (rendering, redirecting, etc)

2. Rendering : show a design (erb) on the same URL
Redirecting: sends to a new URL

3. <%= %>

5. instance variable in sinatra are used to show/not show parts of the html.
